  Ensure 'remote access' database flag for Cloud SQL SQL Server instance is set to 'off'
description: >
  The remote access option controls the execution of stored procedures from local or remote servers on which instances of SQL Server are running.
  The default value for this option is 1.
  This grants permission to run local stored procedures from remote servers or remote stored procedures from the local server.
  To prevent local stored procedures from being run from a remote server
  or remote stored procedures from being run on the local server, this must be disabled.
  The Remote Access option controls the execution of local stored procedures on remote servers or remote stored procedures on local server.
  'Remote access' functionality can be abused to launch a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack on remote servers
  by off-loading query processing to a target, hence this should be disabled
