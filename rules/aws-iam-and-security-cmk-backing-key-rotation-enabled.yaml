  Ensure rotation for customer created CMKs is enabled
description: >
  AWS Key Management Service (KMS) allows customers to rotate the backing key which is
  key material stored within the KMS which is tied to the key ID of the Customer Created
  customer master key (CMK). It is the backing key that is used to perform cryptographic
  operations such as encryption and decryption. Automated key rotation currently retains all
  prior backing keys so that decryption of encrypted data can take place transparently. It is
  recommended that CMK key rotation be enabled
