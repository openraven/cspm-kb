  Ensure that the 'local_infile' database flag for a Cloud SQL Mysql instance is set to 'off'
description: >
  The local_infile flag controls the server-side LOCAL capability for LOAD DATA statements.
  Depending on the local_infile setting, the server refuses or permits local data loading by clients that have LOCAL enabled on the client side.
  Due to security issues associated with the local_infile flag, it is recommended to disable it.
