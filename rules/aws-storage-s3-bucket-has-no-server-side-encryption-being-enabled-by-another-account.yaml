ruleName: >
  Ensure S3 bucket has no server-side encryption being enabled by another account
description: >
  S3 bucket policies allow uploaded files to be encrypted with AES256,
  or forcing any uploaded file to be encrypted with a specific AWS KMS key.
  In the case when a specified KMS Key belongs to a different account it leads to a high risk of encryption of the data
  without the ability to decrypt it.
