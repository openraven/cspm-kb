  Ensure 'log_duration' database flag for Cloud SQL PostgreSQL instance is set to 'on'
description: >
  Enabling the log_duration setting causes the duration of each completed statement to be logged.
  This does not logs the text of the query and thus behaves different from the log_min_duration_statement flag
  Monitoring the time taken to execute the queries can be crucial in identifying any resource hogging queries and assessing the performance of the server.
  Further steps such as load balancing and use of optimized queries can be taken to ensure the performance and stability of the server.
  By default log_duration is off.
