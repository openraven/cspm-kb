description: >
  The rule is COMPLIANT if the status is enabled or enabling.
  ** Encryption by default on Amazon DynamoDB is enabled and cannot be disabled. **
  ** DynamoDB transparently encrypts and decrypts all tables when they are written to disk. **
  ** There is no option to enable or disable encryption at rest. **
