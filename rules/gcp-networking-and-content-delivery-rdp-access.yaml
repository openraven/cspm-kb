type: asset
ruleName: >
  Ensure that RDP access is restricted from the Internet
description: >
  To have outgoing Internet access, the network must have a valid Internet gateway route or custom route whose destination IP is specified.
  This route simply defines the path to the Internet,
  to avoid the most general (0.0.0.0/0) destination IP Range specified from the Internet through RDP with the default Port 3389.
  Generic access from the Internet to a specific IP Range should be restricted.
