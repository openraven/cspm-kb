  Ensure that Cloud SQL database instances are not open to the world
description: >
  To minimize attack surface on a Database server instance, only trusted/known and required IP(s) should be white-listed to connect to it.
  An authorized network should not have IPs/networks configured to 0.0.0.0/0 which will allow access to the instance from anywhere in the world.
  Note that authorized networks apply only to instances with public IPs.
