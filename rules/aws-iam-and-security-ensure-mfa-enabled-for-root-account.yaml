  Ensure MFA is enabled for the "root" account
description: >
  The root account is the most privileged user in an AWS account. MFA adds an extra layer of
  protection on top of a user name and password. With MFA enabled, when a user signs in to
  an AWS website, they will be prompted for their user name and password as well as for an
  authentication code from their AWS MFA device.
