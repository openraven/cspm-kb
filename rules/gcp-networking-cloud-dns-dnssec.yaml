  Ensure that DNSSEC is enabled for Cloud DNS
description: >
  Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) adds security to the DNS protocol by enabling DNS responses to be validated.
  Attackers can hijack this process of domain/IP lookup and redirect users to a malicious site through DNS hijacking and man-in- the-middle attacks.
  DNSSEC helps mitigate the risk of such attacks by cryptographically signing DNS records. As a result,
  it prevents attackers from issuing fake DNS responses that may misdirect browsers to nefarious websites.
