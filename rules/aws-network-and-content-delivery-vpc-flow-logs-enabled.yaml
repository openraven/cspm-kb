  Ensure VPC flow logging is enabled in all VPCs
description: >
  VPC Flow Logs is a feature that enables you to capture information about the IP traffic
  going to and from network interfaces in your VPC. After you've created a flow log, you can
  view and retrieve its data in Amazon CloudWatch Logs. It is recommended that VPC Flow
  Logs be enabled for packet "Rejects" for VPCs.
