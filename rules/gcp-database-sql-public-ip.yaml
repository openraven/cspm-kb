  Ensure that Cloud SQL database instances do not have public IPs
description: >
  To lower the organization's attack surface, Cloud SQL databases should not have public IPs.
  Private IPs provide improved network security and lower latency for your application.
  It is recommended to configure Second Generation Sql instance to use private IPs instead of public IPs.
  PRIMARY ipAddress type is prohibited
  An instance can have both a private and public address at the same time.
  Note also that you cannot use private IP with First Generation instances.
