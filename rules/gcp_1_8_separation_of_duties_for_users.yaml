  Ensure that Separation of duties is enforced while assigning service account related roles to users
description: >
  Separation of duties is the concept of ensuring that one individual does not have all necessary permissions to be able to complete a malicious action.
  In Cloud IAM - service accounts, this could be an action such as using a service account to access resources that user should not normally have access to.
  No user should have Service Account Admin and Service Account Userroles assigned at the same time.
