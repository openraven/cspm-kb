  Ensure '3625 (trace flag)' database flag for Cloud SQL SQL Server instance is set to 'off'
description: >
  Trace flags are frequently used to diagnose performance issues or to debug stored procedures or complex computer systems,
  but they may also be recommended by Microsoft Support to address behavior that is negatively impacting a specific workload.
  All documented trace flags and those recommended by Microsoft Support are fully supported in a production environment when used as directed.
  3625(trace log) Limits the amount of information returned to users who are not members of the sysadmin fixed server role,
  by masking the parameters of some error messages using '******'.
  This can help prevent disclosure of sensitive information, hence this is recommended to disable this flag
