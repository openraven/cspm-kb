  Ensure that instances are not configured to use the default service account
description: >
  The default Compute Engine service account has the Editor role on the project, which allows read and write access to most Google Cloud Services.
  To defend against privilege escalations if your VM is compromised and prevent an attacker from gaining access to all of your project,
  it is recommended to not use the default Compute Engine service account.
  Instead, you should create a new service account and assigning only the permissions needed by your instance.
