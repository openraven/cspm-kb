  Ensure that Service Account has no Admin privilege
description: >
  Service accounts represent service-level security of the Resources (application or a VM) which can be determined by the roles assigned to it.
  Enrolling ServiceAccount with Admin rights gives full access to an assigned application or a VM.
  A ServiceAccount Access holder can perform critical actions like delete, update change settings, etc. without user intervention.
  For this reason, it's recommended that service accounts not have Admin rights.
