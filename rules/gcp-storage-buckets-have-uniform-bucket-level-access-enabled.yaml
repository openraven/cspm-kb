  Ensure that Cloud Storage buckets have uniform bucket-level access enabled
description: >
  Cloud Storage has uniform bucket- level access.
  Using this feature disables ACLs for all Cloud Storage resources: access to Cloud Storage resources then is granted exclusively through Cloud IAM.
  Enabling uniform bucket-level access guarantees that if a Storage bucket is not publicly accessible, no object in the bucket is publicly accessible either.
