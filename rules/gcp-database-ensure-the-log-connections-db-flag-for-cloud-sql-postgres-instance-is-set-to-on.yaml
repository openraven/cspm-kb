  Ensure that the 'log_connections' database flag for Cloud SQL PostgreSQL instance is set to 'on'
description: >
  PostgreSQL does not log attempted connections by default.
  Enabling the log_connections setting will create log entries for each attempted connection
  as well as successful completion of client authentication
  which can be useful in troubleshooting issues and to determine any unusual connection attempts to the server
  By default log_connections is off.
